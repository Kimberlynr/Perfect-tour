  <h1 class='font'>The Perfect Vacation Tour</h1>
  <h5>By Kimberlyn Rodriguez</h5>
  <h6>Published: 1 day ago.</h6>
  <p> Welcome to the page of a 20-year old woman that dreams about traveling all the time. And I know that if you are here, you are also looking to one day experience your dream vacation tour in any continent of the world; in my case, I will be focusing in Europe. YES YOU HEARD THAT RIGHT!</p>
  <h2>My ideal European tour trip</h2>
  <p> Let's start my dream European tour by describing how peacful I want to be. Let's visualize. I am leaving the United States on a direct flight with my partner. While we are in the plane, we are watching movies, eating the food provided during the flight, while also admiting the views of the sky. Once I get to my first stop to Portugal, I will explore the places in my itenerary such as Faro and Funchal. While I walk through the streets of Portugal, I enjoy the brease and the smell of sea and summer. Then, I will take the train to Spain and stop for some bocadillos and wine, I will definetly do the same in Italy but with white wine and pasta (Legal age to drink it is 18!!) And I will keep taking the train through all the countries France and Italy such as Switzerland, Belgium, Germany, and Greece. It sounds so dreamy... </p>
